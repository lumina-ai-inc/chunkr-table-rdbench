<td><b>Milestone 1</b><br>For 25 percent of farms in New Zealand, a person responsible for farm management holds a documented annual total of on-farm greenhouse gas emissions, by methods and definitions accepted by the Steering Group, by 31 December 2021.</td>
<td>On track<br>The programme has defined the elements associated with this milestone e.g. definition of a farm, accepted methods, and assessment of tools against the methods. A gap analysis has been completed which has confirmed there are enough current extension programmes to support 25 percent of farms to know their number.</td>

<td><b>Milestone 2</b><br>For all farms in New Zealand, a person responsible for farm management holds a documented annual total of on-farm greenhouse gas emissions, by methods and definitions accepted by the Steering Group, by 31 December 2022.</td>
<td>Monitor<br>The gap analysis has identified gaps in existing extension programmes required to reach 100 percent of farms. Across partner organisations work is underway to extend existing programmes to meet this milestone.</td>

<td><b>Milestone 3</b><br>A pilot of a farm-level accounting and reporting system has been completed by 1 January 2024 across a range of farm types.</td>
<td>In development<br>The design, analysis, and modelling required to make recommendations on an alternative pricing system in March 2022 is in progress. The scope of work required for a pilot will be confirmed in the first half of 2022. The Ministry for Primary Industries is currently in the discovery phase for the IT system which will form a part of the pilot.</td>

<td><b>Milestone 4</b><br>A system for farm-level accounting and reporting of 2024 agricultural greenhouse gas emissions at farm level is in use by all farms by 1 January 2025.</td>
<td>In development<br>The design, analysis, and modelling required to make recommendations on an alternative pricing system in March 2022 is in progress. These recommendations may require legislative changes which could impact timelines. The Ministry for Primary Industries is currently in the discovery phase for the IT system which will form an integral part of the system.
