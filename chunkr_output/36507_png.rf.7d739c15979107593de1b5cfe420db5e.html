<tr><td>Sampling techniques</td><td>Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. <br> <br>Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.</td><td>4m composite samples taken with a hand size aluminium scoop being thrust into samples piles on the ground. 1m single splits taken off rig with cone splitter and later submitted to lab if >0.2 g/t. Average sample weights about 1.5-2kg.<br> <br>For AC and RC drilling regular air and manual cleaning of cyclone to remove hung up clays where present. Standards & replicate assays taken by the laboratory. Based on statistical analysis of these results, there is no evidence to suggest the samples are not representative.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report. In cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (e.g. 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other</td><td>AC and RC was used to obtain 1m samples from which approximately 1.5-2kg was pulverised to produce a 50 g charge for fire assay. RC chips were geologically logged over 1m intervals, initially sampled over 4m composite intervals and then specific anomalous intervals were sampled over 1m intervals. Depending on the final hole depth, the maximum composite interval was 4m and minimum was 1m. Samples assayed for Au only for this program. Drilling intersected oxide and transitional mineralisation at an average depth of 30-60m downhole meters. Assays </td></tr>
